# Java Programming I course — University of Helsinki
Repository where I can share my solutions to the exercises of the Java Programming I course, which is offered for free by the University of Helsink.

I use Test My Code plugin in the NetBeans IDE (or "TMCBens"), where I can download the exercises from the University server and test my solution.
